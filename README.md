# Project Description
MarketAI.exe allows you to detect and recognize faces, texts, and objects. User can either use the local computer or an Arduino module to input data. It supports real-time face detection, face recognition and object recognition. It is built using Java on the Spring Boot framework with the help of OpenCV (4.5.1) library. This two-member team project ([Nikhil Jain Kamal]( https://github.com/nikhil-jain-k ) and [Priyal Jain]( https://github.com/priyal-jain1 )) was undertaken as part of an internship with RoyaltyBusayo.

# Prerequisites for MarketAI.exe
1. Minimum version of JRE: 1.7
2. OS: Windows 

# Installation Instructions
1. Copy the MarketAI folder in C:\Program Files\
2. Run the exe file from "MarketAI\exe\MarketAI_v1.exe"
3. To connect to an Arduino Camera Module (OV7670):
   3.1 Connect the PC with port: COM9
   3.2 To find out what USB port your Arduino is connected to
       you could check it on your Control Panel >..
       > Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT) > right click >.. 
       ..Properties > Port Settings > Advanced.. 
       > COM Port Number > /Select Your Port Number/
   3.3 In MarketAI.exe, select: File > Read Image from Arduino
   
# Features
## Detect Faces ##
After uploading an image, the user can select ***Detect Faces*** option from the ***Features*** tab in the GUI. An image would be displayed highlighting the faces in the image with the no. of faces detected.

## Detect Objects ##
The user can select ***Detect Objects*** option from the ***Features*** tab. An image would be displayed highlighting the objects and their names.

## Detect Text ##
After uploading an image, the user can select ***Detect Text*** option from the ***Features*** tab in the GUI. An image would be displayed highlighting the text in the image with the no. of words detected.

## Run OCR ## 
In addition to text detection, the OCR feature extracts text from the image.

## Real Time Face Recognition ##
The application can also recognize faces, once they have been saved in the database.

## Real Time Object Detection ##
Similar to ***Detect Objects***; this feature does it in real time.
